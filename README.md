**Konpona** *(from toki pona language: good air)*, improvised ventilator controller

Konpona is a design of a robust, analog circuit for operating improvised medical ventilators.
It provides separate channels for exhale and inhale control, adjustments of duty cycle and timing, separate pressure adjustment by controlling the current flow for powering a DC motor.

The design consists of minimal number of commonly available electronic parts with total bill of materials under 10EUR
Simple circuit can be assembled with minimal effort on a one-sided PCB without SMD elements involved, stripboard, or even using deadbug connections.

Looking forward to contributions: PCB design (preferrably EAGLE) needed.
